## MPA Test Site

- This is where all six web components are deployed for a demo called FauxMazon - a fake shopping cart app

## Notes about documentation on all CWB projects

These projects are almost completely undocumented, to date.

## What is CWB?

This is one of 6 web components designed to be used within an MPA - each within a separate page.

CWB stands for Components With Back end connectivity.

But really it's a take-off on Friends With Benefits - as in why get married to an SPA when you can do something more similar in an MPA?
